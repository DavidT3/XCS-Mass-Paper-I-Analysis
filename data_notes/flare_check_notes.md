# Inspecting the individual ObsIDs for flaring

Paul Giles did all of this inspecting. Any ObsID without a note is definitely flared and should be removed. "Some residual flaring" means that he could see that the observation had suffered from flaring and after cleaning there was still some contamination, though they should be usable still. Other noteable features of the observation are occasionally recorded.
