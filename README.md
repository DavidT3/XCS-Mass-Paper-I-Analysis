# XCS-Mass-Paper-I-Analysis
Analysis code and samples for the first XCS cluster mass measurement paper, where we demonstrate our method and perform tests on values from literature

The analysis code and files in this repository were used to produce the results in the XCS mass method paper. We attempt to provide clear descriptions of everything we do in those notebooks.

We do not include the spectra and other products generated by XGA because the size of those files makes them incompatible with GitHub - if you wish to request access to them we will do our best to send them to you (david.turner@sussex.ac.uk).
